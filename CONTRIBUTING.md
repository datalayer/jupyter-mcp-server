## Development Setup

To get started with development, you'll need to set up your environment.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/datalayer/jupyter-mcp-server
    cd jupyter-mcp-server
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    # Install the project in editable mode with test dependencies
    pip install -e ".[test]"
    ```

3.  **Make Some Amazing Changes!**
    ```bash
    # Make some amazing changes to the source code!
    ```

4.  **Run Tests:**
    ```bash
    make test
    ```

## (Optional) Manual Agent Testing

1.  **Build Python Package:**
    ```bash
    make build
    ```

2. **Set Up Your Environment:**
    ```bash
    pip install jupyterlab==4.4.1 jupyter-collaboration==4.0.2 ipykernel
    pip uninstall -y pycrdt datalayer_pycrdt
    pip install datalayer_pycrdt==0.12.17
    ```

3.  **Start Jupyter Server:**
    ```bash
    jupyter lab --port 8888 --IdentityProvider.token MY_TOKEN --ip 0.0.0.0
    ```

4.  **Set Up Your MCP Client:**
    We recommend using `uvx` to start the MCP server, first install `uvx` with `pip install uv`.

    ```bash
    pip install uv
    uv --version
    # should be 0.6.14 or higher
    ```

    Then, set up your MCP client with the following configuration file.

    ```json
    {
        "mcpServers": {
            "Jupyter-MCP": {
                "command": "uvx",
                "args": [
                    "--from",
                    "your/path/to/jupyter-mcp-server/dist/jupyter_mcp_server-x.x.x-py3-none-any.whl",
                    "jupyter-mcp-server"
                ],
                "env": {
                    "DOCUMENT_URL": "http://localhost:8888",
                    "DOCUMENT_TOKEN": "MY_TOKEN",
                    "DOCUMENT_ID": "notebook.ipynb",
                    "RUNTIME_URL": "http://localhost:8888",
                    "RUNTIME_TOKEN": "MY_TOKEN",
                    "ALLOW_IMG_OUTPUT": "true"
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```

5.  **Test Your Changes:**

    You Can Test Your Changes with your favorite MCP client(e.g. Cursor, Gemini CLI, etc.).
