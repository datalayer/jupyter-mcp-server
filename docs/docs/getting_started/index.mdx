# Getting Started 

To use Jupyter MCP Server, you first need to decide which setup fits your needs:

- ***MCP Server Location*** - It can be running as a **Standalone MCP Server** or inside the Jupyter Server **as a Jupyter Server Extension** - The last one has for advantage to avoid running 2 separate servers (Jupyter server + MCP server) but only supports Streamable HTTP transport.
- ***MCP Transport*** - It supports both ***STDIO Transport*** and ***Streamable HTTP Transport***
- ***Jupyter Provider*** - It can connect to a **local or remote Jupyter server**, to [**Datalayer**](https://datalayer.ai) or to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) hosted Notebooks.

This guide will help you set up a Jupyter MCP Server to connect your preferred MCP client to a JupyterLab instance.

The Jupyter MCP Server acts as a bridge between the MCP client and the JupyterLab server, allowing you to interact with Jupyter notebooks seamlessly.

You can customize the setup further based on your requirements. Refer to the [server configuration](/configuration) for more details on the possible configurations.

Jupyter MCP Server supports two types of transport to connect to your MCP client: **STDIO** and **Streamable HTTP**. Choose the one that best fits your needs.
For more details on the different transports, refer to the official MCP documentation [here](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/transports).

If you choose Streamable HTTP transport, you can also choose to run the MCP server **as a Jupyter Server Extension** or **as a Standalone Server**. Running the MCP server as a Jupyter Server Extension has the advantage of not requiring to run two separate servers (Jupyter server + MCP server).
