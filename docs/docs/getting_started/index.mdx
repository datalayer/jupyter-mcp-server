# Getting Started 

To use Jupyter MCP Server, you first need to decide which setup fits your needs:

- **MCP Server Location** - It can be running as a [**Standalone MCP Server**](/providers/jupyter-streamable-http-standalone) or inside the Jupyter Server [**as a Jupyter Server Extension**](/providers/jupyter-streamable-http-extension) - The last one has for advantage to avoid running 2 separate servers (Jupyter server + MCP server) but only supports Streamable HTTP transport.
- **MCP Transport** - It supports both [**STDIO Transport**](/providers/jupyter-stdio) and **Streamable HTTP Transport**
- **Jupyter Provider** - It can connect to a **local or remote Jupyter server**, to [**JupyterHub**](/providers/jupyterhub-streamable-http), to [**Datalayer**](/providers/datalayer) or to [**Google Colab**](/providers/google-colab) hosted Notebooks.

This guide will help you set up a Jupyter MCP Server to connect your preferred MCP client to a JupyterLab instance.

The Jupyter MCP Server acts as a bridge between the MCP client and the JupyterLab server, allowing you to interact with Jupyter notebooks seamlessly.

You can customize the setup further based on your requirements. Refer to the [server configuration](/reference/configuration) for more details on the possible configurations.

## Choosing Your Transport

Jupyter MCP Server supports two types of transport to connect to your MCP client: **STDIO** and **Streamable HTTP**. Choose the one that best fits your needs.

For more details on the different transports, refer to the official MCP documentation [here](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/transports).

### STDIO Transport

**Best for:** Desktop applications, Docker deployments, single-user setups

- ✅ Simple configuration
- ✅ Works with most MCP clients (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code)
- ✅ No additional server ports needed
- ❌ One client connection at a time

👉 [Get started with STDIO Transport](/providers/jupyter-stdio)

### Streamable HTTP Transport

**Best for:** Web applications, multiple concurrent clients, production deployments

- ✅ Multiple clients can connect simultaneously
- ✅ Web-based access
- ✅ Can run as Jupyter Server Extension (no separate MCP server process)
- ❌ Requires opening network ports

If you choose Streamable HTTP transport, you can also choose to run the MCP server:

- [**As a Jupyter Server Extension**](/providers/jupyter-streamable-http-extension) - MCP server runs inside Jupyter (recommended, simpler setup)
- [**As a Standalone Server**](/providers/jupyter-streamable-http-standalone) - MCP server runs as a separate process

## Provider Options

### Local/Remote Jupyter Server

Connect to any standard JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook server.

👉 Choose your transport:
- [STDIO Transport](/providers/jupyter-stdio)
- [Streamable HTTP (Standalone)](/providers/jupyter-streamable-http-standalone)
- [Streamable HTTP (Extension)](/providers/jupyter-streamable-http-extension)

### JupyterHub

Multi-user deployments with authentication and resource management.

👉 [JupyterHub Setup Guide](/providers/jupyterhub-streamable-http)

:::tip Multi-User Deployments
If you're deploying for multiple users, see the [Multi-User Documentation](/reference/multi-users) for architecture patterns and best practices.
:::

### Datalayer Platform

Enterprise-grade hosted Jupyter with built-in collaboration and security features.

👉 [Datalayer Provider Documentation](/providers/datalayer)

### Google Colab

Connect to Google Colab notebooks (experimental).

👉 [Google Colab Provider Documentation](/providers/google-colab)

## MCP Client Configuration

Once you've set up your MCP server, you need to configure your MCP client. Choose your client:

- [Claude Desktop](/clients/claude_desktop) - Anthropic's desktop app
- [VS Code](/clients/vscode) - GitHub Copilot integration
- [Cursor](/clients/cursor) - AI-first code editor
- [Cline](/clients/cline) - VS Code extension
- [Windsurf](/clients/windsurf) - Collaborative coding environment

## Next Steps

After setting up your MCP server and client:

🔧 **Explore Available Tools** - Learn about the [MCP tools](/reference/tools) for interacting with notebooks

📝 **Use Prompts** - Discover [prompt features](/reference/prompts) for citing and referencing notebooks

🔒 **Secure Your Deployment** - Review [security best practices](/reference/security) for token management and authentication
