**Jupyter MCP Server** is a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) (MCP) server implementation that enables **real-time** interaction with 📓 Jupyter Notebooks, allowing AI to edit, document and execute code for data analysis, visualization etc.

Compatible with any Jupyter deployment (local, JupyterHub, ...) and with [Datalayer](https://datalayer.ai) hosted Notebooks. [Open an issue](https://github.com/datalayer/jupyter-mcp-server/issues) to discuss adding your solution as provider.

Key features include:

- ⚡ **Real-time control:** Instantly view notebook changes as they happen.
- 🔁 **Smart execution:** Automatically adjusts when a cell run fails thanks to cell output feedback.
- 🤝 **MCP-Compatible:** Works with any MCP client, such as [Claude Desktop](/clients/claude_desktop), [Cursor](/clients/cursor), [Cline](/clients/cline), [Windsurf](/clients/windsurf) and more.

To use Jupyter MCP Server, you first need to decide which setup fits your needs:
- ***Editor***: Do you want to interact with notebooks in JupyterLab or with Datalayer hosted Notebooks?
- ***MCP server location***: Do you want to run the MCP server locally on your machine, or on a remote server?

Navigate to the relevant section in the [Setup](./setup) page to get started based on your needs.
