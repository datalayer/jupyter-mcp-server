# Tools

The server currently offers 13 tools:

#### 1. `append_execute_code_cell`

- Append at the end of the notebook a code cell with the provided source and execute it.
- Input:
  - `cell_source`(string): Code source.
- Returns: List of outputs from the executed cell.

#### 2. `append_markdown_cell`

- Input:
  - `cell_source`(string): Markdown source.
- Returns: Success message.

#### 3. `insert_execute_code_cell`

- Insert a code cell at a specific index in the notebook and execute it.
- Input:
  - `cell_index`(int): Index where the cell should be inserted (0-based).
  - `cell_source`(string): Code to be executed.
- Returns: Cell output.

#### 4. `insert_markdown_cell`

- Insert a markdown cell at a specific index in the notebook.
- Input:
  - `cell_index`(int): Index where the cell should be inserted (0-based).
  - `cell_source`(string): Markdown source.
- Returns: Success message.

#### 5. `delete_cell`

- Delete a specific cell from the notebook.
- Input:
  - `cell_index`(int): Index of the cell to delete (0-based).
- Returns: Success message.

#### 6. `get_notebook_info`

- Get basic information about the notebook.
- Returns: Dictionary with notebook path, total cells, and cell type counts.

#### 7. `read_cell`

- Read a specific cell from the notebook.
- Input:
  - `cell_index`(int): Index of the cell to read (0-based).
- Returns: Dictionary with cell index, type, source, and outputs (for code cells).

#### 8. `read_all_cells`

- Read all cells from the notebook.
- Returns:  List of cell information including index, type, source, and outputs (for code cells).

#### 9. `list_cell`

- List the basic information of all cells in the notebook.
- Returns a formatted table showing the index, type, execution count (for code cells), and first line of each cell.
- Provides a quick overview of the notebook structure and is useful for locating specific cells for operations.
- Input: None
- Returns: Formatted table string with cell information (Index, Type, Count, First Line).

#### 10. `overwrite_cell_source`

- Overwrite the source of an existing cell.
- Input:
  - `cell_index`(int): Index of the cell to overwrite (0-based).
  - `cell_source`(string): New cell source - must match existing cell type.
- Returns: Success message and diff style.

#### 11. `execute_cell_streaming`

- Execute cell with streaming progress updates. To be used for long-running cells.
- Input:
  - `cell_index`: Index of the cell to execute (0-based)
  - `timeout_seconds`: Maximum time to wait for execution (default: 300s)
  - `progress_interval`: Seconds between progress updates (default: 5s)
- Returns:
  - `list[str]`: List of outputs including progress updates

#### 12. `execute_cell_simple_timeout`

- Execute a cell with simple timeout (no forced real-time sync). To be used for short-running cells. This won't force real-time updates but will work reliably.
- Input:
  - `cell_index`: Index of the cell to execute (0-based)
  - `timeout_seconds`: Maximum time to wait for execution (default: 300s)
- Returns:
  - `list[str]`: List of outputs from the executed cell

#### 13. `execute_cell_with_progress`

- Execute a specific cell with timeout and progress monitoring.
- Input:
  - `cell_index`: Index of the cell to execute (0-based)
  - `timeout_seconds`: Maximum time to wait for execution (default: 300s)
- Returns:
  - `list[str]`: List of outputs from the executed cell
