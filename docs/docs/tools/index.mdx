# Tools

The server currently offers 16 tools organized into 3 categories, plus 1 additional JupyterLab-specific tool:

## Server Management Tools (3 tools)

#### 1. `list_files`

- List all files and directories in the Jupyter server's file system.
- This tool recursively lists files and directories from the Jupyter server's content API, showing the complete file structure including notebooks, data files, scripts, and directories.
- Input:
  - `path`(string, optional): The starting path to list from (empty string means root directory)
  - `max_depth`(int, optional): Maximum depth to recurse into subdirectories (default: 3)
- Returns: Tab-separated table with columns: Path, Type, Size, Last_Modified
  - **Path**: Full path to the file or directory
  - **Type**: File type ("file", "directory", "notebook", or "error" if inaccessible)
  - **Size**: File size formatted as B, KB, or MB (empty for directories)
  - **Last_Modified**: Last modification timestamp in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS format

#### 2. `list_kernels`

- List all available kernels in the Jupyter server.
- This tool shows all running and available kernel sessions on the Jupyter server, including their IDs, names, states, connection information, and kernel specifications. Useful for monitoring kernel resources and identifying specific kernels for connection.
- Input: None
- Returns: Tab-separated table with columns: ID, Name, Display_Name, Language, State, Connections, Last_Activity, Environment
  - **ID**: Unique kernel identifier
  - **Name**: Kernel name/type (e.g., "python3", "ir", etc.)
  - **Display_Name**: Human-readable kernel name from kernel spec
  - **Language**: Programming language supported by the kernel
  - **State**: Current execution state ("idle", "busy", "unknown")
  - **Connections**: Number of active connections to this kernel
  - **Last_Activity**: Timestamp of last kernel activity in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS format
  - **Environment**: Environment variables defined in the kernel spec (truncated if long)

#### 3. `assign_kernel_to_notebook`

- Assign a kernel to a notebook by creating a Jupyter session.
- This creates a Jupyter server session that connects a notebook file to a kernel, enabling code execution in the notebook. Sessions are the mechanism Jupyter uses to maintain the relationship between notebooks and their kernels.
- Input:
  - `notebook_path`(string): Path to the notebook file, relative to the Jupyter server root (e.g. "notebook.ipynb")
  - `kernel_id`(string): ID of the kernel to assign to the notebook
  - `session_name`(string, optional): Optional name for the session (defaults to notebook path)
- Returns: Success message with session information including session ID

## Multi-Notebook Management Tools (4 tools)

#### 4. `use_notebook`

- Connect to a notebook file or create a new one.
- Input:
  - `notebook_name`(string): Unique identifier for the notebook
  - `notebook_path`(string, optional): Path to the notebook file, relative to the Jupyter server root (e.g. "notebook.ipynb"). If not provided, switches to an already-connected notebook with the given name.
  - `mode`(string): "connect" to connect to existing, "create" to create new (default: "connect")
  - `kernel_id`(string, optional): Specific kernel ID to use (optional, will create new if not provided)
- Returns: Success message with notebook information

#### 5. `list_notebooks`

- List all notebooks in the Jupyter server (including subdirectories) and show which ones are managed by the notebook manager. To interact with a notebook, it has to be "managed". If a notebook is not managed, you can connect to it using the `use_notebook` tool.
- Input: None
- Returns: TSV formatted table with notebook information (Path, Managed, Name, Status, Current)
  - **Path**: Relative path to the notebook file in the Jupyter server
  - **Managed**: "Yes" if the notebook is currently managed by the MCP server, "No" otherwise
  - **Name**: Unique identifier for managed notebooks, "-" for unmanaged notebooks
  - **Status**: Kernel status for managed notebooks ("alive", "dead", etc.), "-" for unmanaged notebooks
  - **Current**: "✓" if this is the currently active managed notebook, empty otherwise

#### 6. `restart_notebook`

- Restart the kernel for a specific notebook.
- Input:
  - `notebook_name`(string): Notebook identifier to restart
- Returns: Success message

#### 7. `unuse_notebook`

- Unuse from a specific notebook and release its resources.
- Input:
  - `notebook_name`(string): Notebook identifier to disconnect
- Returns: Success message

## Cell Tools (9 tools)

#### 8. `insert_cell`

- Insert a cell to specified position with unified API.
- Input:
  - `cell_index`(int): Target index for insertion (0-based). Use -1 to append at end.
  - `cell_type`(string): Type of cell to insert ("code" or "markdown").
  - `cell_source`(string): Source content for the cell.
- Returns: Success message and the structure of its surrounding cells (up to 5 cells above and 5 cells below).

#### 9. `insert_execute_code_cell`

- Insert and execute a code cell in a Jupyter notebook.
- Input:
  - `cell_index`(int): Index of the cell to insert (0-based). Use -1 to append at end and execute.
  - `cell_source`(string): Code source.
- Returns: List of outputs from the executed cell (supports multimodal output including images).

#### 10. `delete_cell`

- Delete a specific cell from the notebook.
- Input:
  - `cell_index`(int): Index of the cell to delete (0-based).
- Returns: Success message.

#### 11. `read_cell`

- Read a specific cell from the notebook.
- Input:

#### 14. `overwrite_cell_source`

- Overwrite the source of an existing cell.
- Input:
  - `cell_index`(int): Index of the cell to overwrite (0-based).
  - `cell_source`(string): New cell source - must match existing cell type.

  - `progress_interval`: Seconds between progress updates when stream=True (default: 5s)
- Returns:
  - `list[Union[str, ImageContent]]`: List of outputs from the executed cell (supports multimodal output including images)
- Use `stream=False` for short-running cells (more reliable)
- Use `stream=True` for long-running cells (provides real-time feedback)

#### 16. `execute_ipython`

- Execute IPython code directly in the kernel on the current active notebook.

## JupyterLab-Specific Tools (1 tool)

*Available only when JupyterLab mode is enabled (`--jupyterlab` or `jupyterlab: true` in config). It is set to `True` by default.*

#### 17. `notebook_run-all-cells`

- Execute all cells in the current notebook sequentially.
- This tool provides a convenient way to run the entire notebook from start to finish, which is particularly useful for batch execution or notebook validation.
- Only available when JupyterLab mode is enabled for enhanced UI integration.
- Input: None
- Returns: Success message indicating that all cells have been executed
- Note: This tool uses JupyterLab's native execution commands for optimal performance and UI feedback.
