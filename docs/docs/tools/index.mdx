# Tools

The server currently offers 18 tools organized into 3 categories:

## Multi-Notebook Management Tools (4 tools)

#### 1. `use_notebook`

- Connect to a notebook file or create a new one.
- Input:
  - `notebook_name`(string): Unique identifier for the notebook
  - `notebook_path`(string, optional): Path to the notebook file, relative to the Jupyter server root (e.g. "notebook.ipynb"). If not provided, switches to an already-connected notebook with the given name.
  - `mode`(string): "connect" to connect to existing, "create" to create new (default: "connect")
  - `kernel_id`(string, optional): Specific kernel ID to use (optional, will create new if not provided)
- Returns: Success message with notebook information

#### 2. `list_notebooks`

- List all notebooks in the Jupyter server (including subdirectories) and show which ones are managed by the notebook manager. To interact with a notebook, it has to be "managed". If a notebook is not managed, you can connect to it using the `use_notebook` tool.
- Input: None
- Returns: TSV formatted table with notebook information (Path, Managed, Name, Status, Current)
  - **Path**: Relative path to the notebook file in the Jupyter server
  - **Managed**: "Yes" if the notebook is currently managed by the MCP server, "No" otherwise
  - **Name**: Unique identifier for managed notebooks, "-" for unmanaged notebooks
  - **Status**: Kernel status for managed notebooks ("alive", "dead", etc.), "-" for unmanaged notebooks
  - **Current**: "âœ“" if this is the currently active managed notebook, empty otherwise

#### 3. `restart_notebook`

- Restart the kernel for a specific notebook.
- Input:
  - `notebook_name`(string): Notebook identifier to restart
- Returns: Success message

#### 4. `unuse_notebook`

- Unuse from a specific notebook and release its resources.
- Input:
  - `notebook_name`(string): Notebook identifier to disconnect
- Returns: Success message

## Server Management Tools (3 tools)

- Input: None
- Returns: Tab-separated table with columns: ID, Name, Display_Name, Language, State, Connections, Last_Activity, Environment
  - **ID**: Unique kernel identifier
  - **Name**: Kernel name/type (e.g., "python3", "ir", etc.)

  - **Language**: Programming language supported by the kernel
  - **State**: Current execution state ("idle", "busy", "unknown")
  - **Connections**: Number of active connections to this kernel
  - **Last_Activity**: Timestamp of last kernel activity in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS format
  - **Environment**: Environment variables defined in the kernel spec (truncated if long)

#### 7. `assign_kernel_to_notebook`

- Assign a kernel to a notebook by creating a Jupyter session.
- This creates a Jupyter server session that connects a notebook file to a kernel, enabling code execution in the notebook. Sessions are the mechanism Jupyter uses to maintain the relationship between notebooks and their kernels.
- Input:
  - `notebook_path`(string): Path to the notebook file, relative to the Jupyter server root (e.g. "notebook.ipynb")
  - `kernel_id`(string): ID of the kernel to assign to the notebook
  - `session_name`(string, optional): Optional name for the session (defaults to notebook path)
- Returns: Success message with session information including session ID

## Cell Tools (11 tools)

#### 8. `insert_cell`

- Insert a cell to specified position with unified API.
- Input:
  - `cell_index`(int): Target index for insertion (0-based). Use -1 to append at end.
  - `cell_type`(string): Type of cell to insert ("code" or "markdown").
  - `cell_source`(string): Source content for the cell.
- Returns: Success message and the structure of its surrounding cells (up to 5 cells above and 5 cells below).

#### 9. `insert_execute_code_cell`

- Insert and execute a code cell in a Jupyter notebook.
- Input:
  - `cell_index`(int): Index of the cell to insert (0-based). Use -1 to append at end and execute.
  - `cell_source`(string): Code source.
- Returns: List of outputs from the executed cell (supports multimodal output including images).

#### 10. `delete_cell`

#### 13. `list_cells`

- List the basic information of all cells in the notebook.

#### 16. `execute_cell_simple_timeout`

- Execute a cell with simple timeout (no forced real-time sync). To be used for short-running cells. This won't force real-time updates but will work reliably.
