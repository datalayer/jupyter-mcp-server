This is the core Prompt component of Jupyter MCP, providing universal and powerful Prompt tools, all prefixed with `jupyter`.

### 1. `jupyter-cite`

This prompt allows users to cite specific cells in a notebook, enabling users to let LLM perform precise subsequent operations on specific cells.

#### Input Parameters

- `--prompt`: User prompt for the cited cells
- `--cell_indices`: Cell indices to cite (0-based), supporting flexible range format
    1. **Single Index**: Cite a single cell, such as `"0"` (cites the 1st cell)
    2. **Range Format**: Cite a continuous range of cells, such as `"0-2"` (cites cells 1 to 3)
    3. **Mixed Format**: Combine single index and range, such as `"0-2,4"` (cites cells 1-3 and cell 5)
    4. **Open-ended Range**: From specified index to the end of notebook, such as `"3-"` (cites from cell 4 to the last cell)
- `--notebook_path`: Name of the notebook to cite cells from, default ("") to current activated notebook

#### Output Format

```
