[Read more in the release notes.](https://jupyter-mcp-server.datalayer.tech/releases)

:::

**Jupyter MCP Server** is a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) (MCP) server implementation that enables **real-time** interaction with 📓 Jupyter Notebooks, allowing AI to edit, document and execute code for data analysis, visualization etc.

Compatible with any Jupyter deployment (local, JupyterHub, ...) and with [Datalayer](https://datalayer.ai) hosted Notebooks. [Open an issue](https://github.com/datalayer/jupyter-mcp-server/issues) to discuss adding your solution as provider.

Key features include:

- ⚡ **Real-time control:** Instantly view notebook changes as they happen.
- 🔁 **Smart execution:** Automatically adjusts when a cell run fails thanks to cell output feedback.
- 🧠 **Context-aware:** Understands the entire notebook context for more relevant interactions.
- 📊 **Multimodal support:** Support different output types, including images, plots, and text.
- 📁 **Multi-notebook support:** Seamlessly switch between multiple notebooks.
- 🤝 **MCP-compatible:** Works with any MCP client, such as [Claude Desktop](/clients/claude_desktop), [Cursor](/clients/cursor), [Cline](/clients/cline), [Windsurf](/clients/windsurf) and more.

To use Jupyter MCP Server, you first need to decide which setup fits your needs:
- ***Editor***: Do you want to interact with notebooks in Jupyter or with Datalayer hosted Notebooks?
- ***MCP Transport***: Do you want to set up the MCP Server using standard input/output (STDIO) transport or streamable HTTP transport?

Navigate to the relevant section in the [Deployment](./deployment) page to get started based on your needs.
