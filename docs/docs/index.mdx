# About Jupyter MCP Server

**Jupyter MCP Server** is a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) (MCP) server implementation that enables **real-time** interaction with 📓 Jupyter Notebooks, allowing AI to edit, document and execute code for data analysis, visualization etc.
It is compatible with any [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) deployment (local, JupyterHub, ...) and with [Datalayer](https://datalayer.ai) hosted Notebooks. Key features include:

- ⚡ **Real-time control:** Instantly view notebook changes as they happen.
- 🔁 **Smart execution:** Automatically adjusts when a cell run fails thanks to cell output feedback.
- 🧠 **Context-aware:** Understands the entire notebook context for more relevant interactions.
- 📊 **Multimodal support:** Support different output types, including images, plots, and text.
- 📁 **Multi-notebook support:** Seamlessly switch between multiple notebooks.
- 🎛️ **JupyterLab integration:** Enhanced UI integration like automatic notebook opening.
- 🤝 **MCP-compatible:** Works with any MCP client, such as [Claude Desktop](/clients/claude_desktop), [Cursor](/clients/cursor), [Cline](/clients/cline), [Windsurf](/clients/windsurf) and more.
