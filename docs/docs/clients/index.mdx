# Clients

We have tested and validated the Jupyter MCP Server with the following clients:

- [Claude Desktop](./claude_desktop)
- [VS Code](./vscode)
- [Cursor](./cursor)
- [Cline](./cline)
- [Windsurf](./windsurf)

The Jupyter MCP Server is also compatible with **ANY** MCP client â€” see the growing list in [MCP clients](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients). This means that you are **NOT** limited to the clients listed above. Both [STDIO](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/transports#stdio) and [streamable HTTP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/transports#streamable-http) transports are supported.

If you prefer a CLI approach as client, you can use for example the python [mcp-client-cli](https://github.com/adhikasp/mcp-client-cli) package.
