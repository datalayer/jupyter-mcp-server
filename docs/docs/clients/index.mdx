# Clients

We have tested and validated the Jupyter MCP Server with the following clients:

- [Claude Desktop](./claude_desktop)
- [VS Code](./vscode)
- [Cursor](./cursor)
- [Cline](./cline)
- [Windsurf](./windsurf)

The Jupyter MCP Server is also compatible with **ANY** MCP client â€” see the growing list in [MCP clients](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients). This means that you are **NOT** limited to the clients listed above.

Jupyter MCP Server supports both [stdio](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/transports#stdio) and [streamable HTTP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/transports#streamable-http) transports.

## Stdio Transport

Use the following configuration file to set up the Jupyter MCP Server for your preferred MCP client.

Note that the configuration is dependent on the operating system you are using.

:::important

Ensure the `port` of the `ROOM_URL`and `RUNTIME_TOKEN` match those used in the `jupyter lab` command.

The `ROOM_ID` should be relative to the directory where JupyterLab was started.

:::

For MacOS and Windows.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "jupyter": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "-e",
        "ROOM_URL",
        "-e",
        "RUNTIME_TOKEN",
        "-e",
        "ROOM_ID",
        "datalayer/jupyter-mcp-server:latest"
      ],
      "env": {
        "ROOM_URL": "http://host.docker.internal:8888",
        "RUNTIME_TOKEN": "MY_TOKEN",
        "ROOM_ID": "notebook.ipynb"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For Linux.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "jupyter": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "-e",
        "ROOM_URL",
        "-e",
        "RUNTIME_TOKEN",
        "-e",
        "ROOM_ID",
        "--network=host",
        "datalayer/jupyter-mcp-server:latest"
      ],
      "env": {
        "ROOM_URL": "http://localhost:8888",
        "RUNTIME_TOKEN": "MY_TOKEN",
        "ROOM_ID": "notebook.ipynb"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Streamable HTTP Transport

Jupyter MCP Servers also supports streamable HTTP transport, which allows you to connect to the Jupyter MCP Server using a URL.

To start the server, you can either use `python` or `docker`. The server will listen on port `4040`, you can access it via http://localhost:4040.

Use the following configuration for you MCP client to connect to a running MCP Server.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "jupyter": {
        "command": "npx",
        "args": ["mcp-remote", "http://127.0.0.1:4040/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```
