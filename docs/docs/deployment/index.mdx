# Deployment

Jupyter MCP Server can be deployed in various configurations depending on your needs. It can be running inside the Jupyter Server **as a Jupyter Server Extension**, or as a **Standalone Server** connecting to a **local or remote Jupyter server** or to [**Datalayer**](https://datalayer.ai) hosted Notebooks.

Navigate to the relevant section based on your needs:
- ***Jupyter Notebooks***: If you want to interact with notebooks in JupyterLab/JupyterHub.
- ***Datalayer Notebooks***: If you want to interact with notebooks hosted on [Datalayer](https://datalayer.ai).
- ***STDIO Transport***: If you want to set up the MCP Server using standard input/output (STDIO) transport.
- ***Streamable HTTP Transport***: If you want to set up the MCP Server using Streamable HTTP transport.
- ***As a Standalone Server***: If you want to set up the MCP Server as a Standalone Server.
- ***As a Jupyter Server Extension***: If you want to set up the MCP Server as a Jupyter Server Extension. This has for advantage to avoid running 2 separate servers (Jupyter server + MCP server) but only supports Streamable HTTP transport.

You can find below diagrams illustrating the different configurations.

## As a Standalone Server

The following diagram illustrates how **Jupyter MCP Server** connects to a **Jupyter server** or **Datalayer** and communicates with an MCP client.

## As a Jupyter Server Extension

The following diagram illustrates how **Jupyter MCP Server** runs as an extension inside a **Jupyter server** and communicates with an MCP client.
In this configuration, you don't need to run a separate MCP server. It will start automatically when you start your Jupyter server.
Note that only **Streamable HTTP** transport is supported in this configuration.
