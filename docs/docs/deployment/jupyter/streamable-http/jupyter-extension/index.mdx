# As a Jupyter Server Extension

## 1. Start JupyterLab and the MCP Server

### Environment setup

Make sure you have the following packages installed in your environment. The collaboration package is needed as the modifications made on the notebook can be seen thanks to [Jupyter Real Time Collaboration](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/rtc.html).

```bash
pip install "jupyter-mcp-server>=0.15.0" "jupyterlab==4.4.1" "jupyter-collaboration==4.0.2" "ipykernel"
pip uninstall -y pycrdt datalayer_pycrdt
pip install datalayer_pycrdt==0.12.17 jupyter_mcp_tools
```

### JupyterLab and MCP start

Then, start JupyterLab with the following command.

```bash
jupyter lab \
	  --JupyterMCPServerExtensionApp.document_url local \
	  --JupyterMCPServerExtensionApp.runtime_url local \
	  --JupyterMCPServerExtensionApp.document_id notebook.ipynb \
	  --JupyterMCPServerExtensionApp.start_new_runtime True \
	  --ServerApp.disable_check_xsrf True \
	  --IdentityProvider.token MY_TOKEN \
	  --ServerApp.root_dir ./dev/content \
	  --port 4040
  ```

You can also run `start-jupyter-server-extension` if you cloned the repository.

This will start JupyterLab at [http://127.0.0.1:4040](http://127.0.0.1:4040) and the MCP server will be started in the same process.

## 2. Configure your MCP Client

Use the following configuration for you MCP client to connect to a running Jupyter MCP Server.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "jupyter": {
        "command": "npx",
        "args": ["mcp-remote", "http://127.0.0.1:4040/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```
