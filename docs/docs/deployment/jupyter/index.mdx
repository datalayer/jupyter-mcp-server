# Jupyter Notebooks

This guide will help you set up a Jupyter MCP Server to connect your preferred MCP client to a JupyterLab instance.
The Jupyter MCP Server acts as a bridge between the MCP client and the JupyterLab server, allowing you to interact with Jupyter notebooks seamlessly.

You can customize the setup further based on your requirements. Refer to the [server configuration](/configure) for more details on the possible configurations.

Jupyter MCP Server supports two types of transport to connect to your MCP client: **STDIO** and **Streamable HTTP**. Choose the one that best fits your needs.
For more details on the different transports, refer to the official MCP documentation [here](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/transports).

If you choose Streamable HTTP transport, you can also choose to run the MCP server **as a Jupyter Server Extension** or **as a Standalone Server**. Running the MCP server as a Jupyter Server Extension has the advantage of not requiring to run two separate servers (Jupyter server + MCP server).
