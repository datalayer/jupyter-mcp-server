# Jupyter Provider

To get started notebooks hosted on your own JupyterLab or JupyterHub:

- üõ†Ô∏è Setup your environment by following the [Environment Setup Guide](#environment-setup).
- üöÄ Start JupyterLab, refer to [Start JupyterLab Guide](#start-jupyterlab).
- ‚öôÔ∏è Configure your preferred MCP client using the [Jupyter MCP Server Configuration](/clients).

You can now use your favorite [MCP client](/clients) to interact with Jupyter notebooks!

## Environment

Make sure you have the following packages installed in your environment. The collaboration package is needed as the modifications made on the notebook can be seen thanks to [Jupyter Real Time Collaboration](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/rtc.html).

```bash
pip install jupyterlab==4.4.1 jupyter-collaboration==4.0.2 ipykernel
pip uninstall -y pycrdt datalayer_pycrdt
pip install datalayer_pycrdt==0.12.17
```

## Start JupyterLab

Then, start JupyterLab with the following command.

```bash
jupyter lab --port 8888 --IdentityProvider.token MY_TOKEN --ip 0.0.0.0
```

You can also run `make jupyterlab` if you cloned the repository.

:::note

The `--ip` is set to `0.0.0.0` to allow the MCP Server running in a Docker container to access your local JupyterLab.
