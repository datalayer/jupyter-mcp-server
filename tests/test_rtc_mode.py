"""
Test to verify RTC (Real-Time Collaboration) mode is used for cell operations.

This test verifies the fix for the WebSocket disconnect bug:
- Original bug: MCP tools used file mode, causing "Out-of-band changes" and WebSocket disconnects
- Fix: MCP tools now use RTC mode via extension_manager.extension_points['jupyter_server_ydoc']

The test validates:
1. jupyter-collaboration extension is loaded
2. YWebSocket server is accessible
3. Cell edits go through YDoc (RTC mode), not file operations
4. No file-mode fallback occurs when notebook is open
